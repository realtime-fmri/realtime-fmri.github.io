Here we will define real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), first published by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910330213/abstract">Cox et al. (1995)</a> , as any process that uses functional information from a MRI scanner where the analysis and display of the fMRI keep pace with data acquisition. Although modern whole brain fMRI data sampling can be performed in around 500ms <a
href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015710">(Feinberg et al., 2010)</a> , current real-time protocols use sampling rates of arround two seconds. According to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910330213/abstract">Cox et al.</a> first description of rt-fMRI, it can be used to control for quality during normal fMRI scanning, faster protocol development and interactive experimental paradigms. At present, rtfMRI has also been applied to intraoperative surgical guidance <a href="http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~jdvicto/pdfs/hiruki00.pdf">(Hirsch et al., 2000),</a> brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) <a href="http://zoology.ou.edu/pdf_documents/Neuromunch/Sorger%20et%20al%202012%20fMRI-based%20spelling.pdf">(Sorger et al.,  2012;</a> <a
href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911008585"> Yoo et al., 2004)</a>, and neurofeedback. However, as progress in the field advances and the challenges for future research and clinical applications are settled, this could be a powerfull tool aiding diagnostic as well as treatment.

Since rt-fMRI is slowly emerging as a imaging modality with many imaginable applications in basic, translational and clinical neuroscience, here we would like to construct The rt-fMRI for the People Network which will support rt-fMRI studies and will enable researchers to be connected, sharing their experiences through the network. Thus, we'll be able to better share our ideas, comments, resources, tools, experiences, data, and specally trobelshooting and finding ways to overcome current methodologiacal and technical issues. The rt-fMRI for the People Network will facilitate efficient exchange of ideas, tools, resources, experiences and data among anyone interested. We wish The rt-fMRI for the People Network will help to enhance the collaborations among the researchers, especially translate our knowledge into basic neuroscience and incorporate methodologies to clinical applications.

Welcome all, we hope you enjoy it here!
