<h2 id='existing_realtime_fmri_implementations'>Existing real-time fMRI implementations</h2>

<p>There are a variety of ways one can extract fMRI information based on how the brain is responding during an experiment, and then use this information to change stimuli (neurofeedback) or controll brain computer interfaces (BCI).<br />The majority of real-time fMRI has focused on the use of univariate statistical analysis approaches related to the general linear model (GLM) <a href='http://spin.ecn.purdue.edu/fmri/PDFLibrary/FristonK_HBM_1995_2_189_210.pdf'>(Friston et al., 1995b)</a> or to tracking the fMRI signal in one or a few regions of interest (ROIs). However, there are also real-time fMRI approaches that predict brain-states for feedback using distributed brain-state patterns. In other words, it&#8217;s an approach of brain reading rather than that of localized activation.</p>

<p>In this section we will walkthough the different ways of implementing real-time fMRI.</p>

<p>This part describes brain-state prediction real-time fMRI from <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17133383'>LaConte et al. (2007,</a><a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Decoding+fMRI+brain+states+in+real-time+laConte'>2011)</a></p>

<h4 id='advantages'>Advantages</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Multivariate approaches provide a principled method for dealing with distributed patterns of brain responses</p>

<ul>
<li>when network activity is expected</li>

<li>when mental strategies could vary from individual to individual</li>

<li>or when one or a few ROIs are not unequivocally the most appropriate for the investigation</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>No prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies are required</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>* the system learns these directly from the volunteer 3. Feedback can rely on a direct, intuitive translation of brain state, rather than a representation based on increasing or decreasing local activity</p>

<ol>
<li>Near-perfect prediction accuracy (~80%) classifications attainable during sustained periods of activation</li>

<li>Stimulus feedback can respond to changes in the breain state mucha earlier than the time-to-peak limitations of the BOLD response</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='characteristics'>Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>&#8220;Brain states&#8221;</em> <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11906218'>(as in Strother et al., 2002b)</a> are essentially the sensory/behavioral events or mental processes for we might hope to find neural correlates through neuroimaging.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Algorithms usually used in machine learning attempt to estimate this relationship between vector inputs and scalar outputs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>TABS</strong> uses brain volumes from temporally sampled data as vector inputs to a trained model, which then predicts the scalar outputs of brain states that are subsequently used as a control signal to adapt the feedback stimulus.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>TABS&#8217;s</strong> machine learning approach used with modern data acquisition and reconstruction capabilities of modern MRI systems, can allow for greater flexibility of fMRI experimental designs by enabeling adaptive stimuli guided by ongoing detection of the sensory/behavioral states encoded in the hemodynamics of a subjet&#8217;s brain.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Contrary to mass univariate contexts, where <em>&#8220;brain states&#8221;</em> are represented as variates of interest in a design matrix, in supervised machine learning contexts, these regressors serve instead as <em>&#8220;labels.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>When the labels are <strong>categorical</strong> in nature, we can formulate the modeling problem as a classification problem over a set of experimental categories.</p>

<p>When the labels are <strong>continuous</strong>, the problem can be framed as a regression problem to describe parametrically varying brain states such as task difficulty, behavioral rate, visual angle, etc.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multivatiate strategies provide a useful tool in situations where less a priori knowledge exists or subjects can use different cognitive strategies to perform the same task because they have the potential to adapt to the individual and the specific experimental context.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Because <em>&#8220;brain states&#8221;</em>, in many cases, can be empirically observed (if you are a well trained actor and you think of something sad, you could even drop some tears!) and the brain state prediction validated more easily than the statistical map predictions, it gives the oportunity to obtain a robust training data set to estimate this multi voxel pattern analysis parameters for the supervised learning.</p>

<p>TABS implementation represents an active system based on these concepts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that regardless of the analyses performed (supervised, unsupervised, multivariate, mass univariate), the source data are exactly the same and come with the same limitations inherent to fMRI (e.g. voxel size, temporal sampling, and an indirect relationship to cellular brain activity).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='tabs_implementation'>TABS implementation</h3>

<p><strong>The equipment you will need to build an rtfMRI system as shown in Fig. 1:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Depending on the vendor hardware and software architectures, you certainly need the scanner receiver A/D and image reconstruction hardware.</li>

<li>Access to the reconstruction system, which can range from a shared file system to custom reconstruction code that has direct access to the data.</li>

<li>At least one additional computer dedicated to controlling the stimulus delivery and any desired behavioral or physiological recording and the Audio/Video presentation sytem.</li>

<li>A second separate computer to run the real-time software (with shared file and/or network access) or be integrated with (or even fully replace) the image reconstruction software.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Making the actual connections between equipments:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Will depend on the physical layout of the machines, local computer security policiesand, and the actual hardware on the computers, but include:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>parallel</li>

<li>RS232 serial</li>

<li>firewire ports</li>

<li>USB2</li>

<li>Ethernet connections through switches support data communication through protocols such as TCP and hard disk file sharing through NFS and SAMBA.</li>

<li>Bluetooth and/or wireless connections</li>
</ul>

<p>In the implementation reported by LaConte (2007), the image reconstruction system performed all of the real-time calculations (estimating a classification model during training runs and using these models to classify new images during feedback runs) as well as communicating with the stimulus computer. For real-time display, an additional computer running AFNI has since been added. For this to work, additional software was written to run on the image reconstruction computer to send image data to the real-time display computer with TCP/IP, using AFNI&#8217;s real-time plugin. This machine is currently also used for auxiliary computations, such as generating brain vs. non-brain mask images, tracking motion, and updating brain maps. The real-time display computer can also act as a server for the remote observation computer at a distant site. Future plans include transferring all of the real-time calculations to the real-time display computer to fully utilize AFNI&#8217;s real-time enhancements and our efforts to build plugins <a href='http://www.lacontelab.org/3dsvm.htm'>(like 3dsvm)</a> for AFNI.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that these details, by their nature, are outdated quickly, however, the main concerns are that the processor power and data transmission bandwidth are adequate to perform whatever is needed for the experiment. Image data requires the most RAM and/or disk utilization while BCI control signals from ROIs or classifiers usually require only a few bytes. Furthermore, the TABS system for prediction of brain states uses a trained model that is the same for every volume and thus, the computational demand remains fixed for the entire feedback run.</p>

The dotted box represents the relevant subsystems of a typical MRI system, which include the MRI scanner, console, and image reconstruction.</p>

<p>The minimum required equipment that you will need to run a powerfull rt-fMRI on your scanner could look something like this:</p>
