<p>Here we will define real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), first published by <a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910330213/abstract'>Cox et al. (1995)</a> , as any process that uses functional information from a MRI scanner where the analysis and display of the fMRI keep pace with data acquisition. Although modern whole brain fMRI data sampling can be performed in around 500ms <a href='http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015710'>(Feinberg et al., 2010)</a> , current real-time protocols use sampling rates of arround two seconds. According to <a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910330213/abstract'>Cox et al.</a> first description of rt-fMRI, it can be used to control for quality during normal fMRI scanning, faster protocol development and interactive experimental paradigms. At present, rtfMRI has also been applied to intraoperative surgical guidance <a href='http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~jdvicto/pdfs/hiruki00.pdf'>(Hirsch et al., 2000),</a> brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) <a href='http://zoology.ou.edu/pdf_documents/Neuromunch/Sorger%20et%20al%202012%20fMRI-based%20spelling.pdf'>(Sorger et al.,  2012;</a> <a href='http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911008585'> Yoo et al., 2004)</a>, and neurofeedback. However, as progress in the field advances and the challenges for future research and clinical applications are settled, this could be a powerfull tool aiding diagnostic as well as treatment. <br /></p>

<p>Since rt-fMRI is slowly emerging as a imaging modality with many imaginable applications in basic, translational and clinical neuroscience, here we would like to construct The rt-fMRI for the People Network which will support rt-fMRI studies and will enable researchers to be connected, sharing their experiences through the network. Thus, we&#8217;ll be able to better share our ideas, comments, resources, tools, experiences, data, and specally trobelshooting and finding ways to overcome current methodologiacal and technical issues. The rt-fMRI for the People Network will facilitate efficient exchange of ideas, tools, resources, experiences and data among anyone interested. We wish The rt-fMRI for the People Network will help to enhance the collaborations among the researchers, especially translate our knowledge into basic neuroscience and incorporate methodologies to clinical applications.</p>

<p>Welcome all, we hope you enjoy it here!</p>
